Estimated Annual Income ("EAI") and Estimated Yield ("EY") calculations are for informational purposes only and are derived from information provided by outside parties. Schwab cannot guarantee the
accuracy of such information. Since the interest and dividends are subject to change at any time, they should not be relied upon exclusively for making investment decisions. The actual income and yield
might be lower or higher than the estimated amounts. EY is based upon EAI and the current price of the security and will fluctuate. For certain types of securities, the calculations could include a return of
principal or capital gains in which case EAI and EY would be overstated. EY and EAI are not promptly updated to reflect when an issuer has missed a regular payment or announced changes to future
payments, in which case EAI and EY will continue to display at a prior rate.Schwab One® Account    of
